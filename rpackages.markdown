Here I upload R packages and code. For R packages click on
the link and scroll down to see a description.

# R packages

  - [ML](https://github.com/joelters/ML):  simple to use package to estimate
   Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest (RF), Conditional Inference Forest (CIF),
   Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Catboosting (CB) and a SuperLearner
   combining all of these learners.

  - [ineqopp](https://github.com/joelters/ineqopp): the goal of ineqopp is to
   provide estimates  and tests for Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) using
   several methods. Debiased IOp estimates can be computed using any Machine
   Learner among: Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, Conditional Inferest Forest,
   Extreme Gradient Boosting, Catboosting or some combination of these five
   machine learners. Plug in estimates can also be computed estimating the
   fitted values with a log linear regression, non-parametrically (for discrete
   circumstances) or with any of the aforementioned machine learners. Debiased
   partial effects can also be computed. The package includes a survey with
   income and circumstances for Madrid in 2018 (from Encuesta de Condiciones
   de vida (ECV) 2019).
