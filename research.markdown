<li><a href="https://anramosr.github.io/JMP_AndreyRamos.pdf" target="_blank">Quantitative Analysis of Climate Heterogeneity via an Unconditional Quantile Vector Error Correction Model</a>.</li>  
<p></p>
<strong>Abstract</strong>: Econometric modeling of climate systems requires procedures that account for the well-documented heterogeneity in climate dynamics across space and time. This paper introduces a time-series methodology to analyze heterogeneity in the unconditional temperature distribution and its association with different climate drivers. The methodology consists of a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) for a range of unconditional distributional characteristics of temperature —mean and quantiles— alongside the total radiative forcing, including the radiative forcing from anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO2). At global or hemispheric scales, the unconditional quantiles of temperature represent temperature at different latitudes. Thus, based on physics theory from climate models, an equivalence is established between a One-Dimensional (1D) Energy Balance Model (EBM) and an unconditional-quantile VAR model in a restricted Vector Error Correction (VEC) form. Using historical data for the period 1880-2021, the unconditional-quantile VECM is estimated and tested employing time series methods that are robust to the nature of trends in the variables. The methodology produces outcomes of practical interest, including: i) estimation of physical parameters of the 1D-EBM like quantile-dependent climate sensitivities, ii) long-term density forecasts of temperature, iii) identification of distributional shocks and impulse-response analysis, and iv) projection of the temperature distribution under hypothetical emissions/concentrations scenarios. These outcomes are comparable to those from large-scale General Circulation Models and can be incorporated into economic studies (e.g., damage analysis or integrated assessment modeling) to quantify the economic consequences of climate change, while explicitly accounting for different forms of climate heterogeneity. A deeper understanding of global warming dynamics and its consequences its crucial for better informing adaptation and mitigation policies.

<i>This paper examines the impact of severe wildfire events on Bolivia’s poverty and labor market outcomes. We construct a panel dataset from 2005 to 2020 at the municipality level utilizing NASA’s MODIS Collection-6 MCD64A1 burned area product, and merge it with household surveys. To attain survey representativeness at a given geographical level, we aggregate neighboring municipalities through the max-pregion algorithm. Using the Interactive Fixed Effects Counterfactual Estimator, we estimate the causal effects of severe wildfire events on poverty, household per-capita income, and the agricultural sector. We find a significant short-term increase in poverty explained by a temporary decline in household per capita and, specifically, agricultural labor income.</i></details>

<i>This document examines the effect of precipitation shocks on poverty status in Ecuador. Using gridded monthly precipitation data from 2007 to 2021, we define measures for the excess and deficit in precipitation levels at the parish geographical level. This data is merged with household socioeconomic information obtained from the National Survey of Employment, Unemployment, and Underemployment (ENEMDU). Our empirical findings reveal that both excess and deficit in precipitation significantly affect poverty status, with these effects displaying strong heterogeneity across economic sectors. Variations in the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), whether positive or negative, lead to an increased probability of poverty among workers in the primary sector (specifically, those engaged in fishing and agriculture). In contrast, we observe poverty-reducing effects for the secondary and tertiary sectors. Factors such as formality status, urban/rural location, and the nature of employment play crucial roles in moderating the estimated effects. Per-capita household income and labor income are key channels to explain of our findings.</i></details>

<li>Becoming Green: Aggregate and Firm-level Effects of Green Technology News Shock (with <a href="https://oscarjaulin.com/" target="_blank">Oscar Jaulin</a>)</li>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<i>We empirically explore the macroeconomic and firm-level implications of news about future technological advancements in the green sector. Utilizing the economic value of green patents granted to publicly listed companies in the U.S., we identify green technology news shocks via a convenient and meaningful rotation of the innovations from a Bayesian Vector Autorregresion Model (BVAR). These shocks are decomposed into two orthogonal components: i) a common technological component shared by both green and non-green innovation, that reproduces response patterns akin to those expected from a technology news shock with long-run impacts on productivity; and ii) an idiosyncratic component to green innovation inducing inflationary pressures and stock price reductions. The responses to the orthogonal component suggest the existence of a green transition news content that can be related to expectations of more rigorous carbon policies or stricter environmental standards in the future. Our focus on green innovation deepens our understanding about the effect of technology-specific news shocks and provides information of practical importance for macroeconomic and environmental policies.</i>

<li>High-frequency Density Nowcasts of CO2 Emissions in U.S. States (with <a href="https://ignaciogarron.github.io/" target="_blank">Ignacio Garrón</a>)<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<i>This paper proposes an approach to panel density nowcasting for high-frequency data, to produce timely predictions of CO2 emissions and energy consumption growth for U.S. states. Using weekly state-level economic conditions and adopting a mixed-frequency model, we initially forecast energy consumption growth. Subsequently, this information is plugged-in into a bridge equation to predict CO2 emissions growth quantiles, accounting for cross-sectional dependence across states through estimated factors. To capture both asymmetry and excess kurtosis, a skew-t distribution is fitted. The performance of the models is rigorously assessed through an out-of-sample forecasting study, revealing that the weekly nowcasts offer early insights into CO2 emissions and energy consumption growth. Our study contributes to the existing literature on several ways. First, the quantile approach adopted to produce CO2 emissions growth nowcasts allows us to provide a complete description of the uncertainty associated with predictions. Related studies as Bennedsen et al. (2021) and Fosten and Nandi (2023) only produce point predictions at the national and state level, respectively. Second, the use of the weekly state-level economic indicators of Baumeister et al. (2024) implies a higher frequency in the nowcasting exercise compared to the quarterly and monthly frequencies of Bennedsen et al. (2021) and Fosten and Nandi (2023), respectively. The information produced by our analysis is useful to inform policies aiming to reduce regional environmental degradation. The nowcasting exercise is particularly important in this context, given the large publication lags in the U.S. state-level energy consumption and emissions data.</i>

<li>From Paleo-Cooling to Paleo-Warming (with <a href="https://www.eco.uc3m.es/~jgonzalo/" target="_blank">Jesús Gonzalo</a>)</li>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<i>A time-series quantitative methodology to describe trends in the temperature distribution under the assumption of local-stationarity is introduced. The methodology consists of estimating certain distributional characteristics of interest (mean, quantiles, and dispersion measures), testing for the existence of trends, and characterizing heterogeneity in the trend evolution along the temperature distribution. Applying the proposed methodology to the temperature paleoclimate record over the last 800 thousand years, we are able to determine to what extent the currently observed Global Warming dynamics are unusual compared to past changes in Earth’s climate. Our findings indicate that the Global Warming during the last 200 years is completely different to what is observed over the paleoclimate record. Over long-horizon samples covering several glacial-interglacial cycles (800 and 420 thousands of years), our approach detects a clear long-term Paleo-Cooling. If the analysis is restricted to shorter-horizon samples characterized by abrupt increases in temperature, as the last deglaciation (last 27 thousands of years), evidence of Paleo-Warming is obtained; however the intensity and heterogeneity of the current warming are significantly different. We highlight the importance of studying the whole distribution of the temperature to obtain a wide angle picture of climate evolution.</i>
